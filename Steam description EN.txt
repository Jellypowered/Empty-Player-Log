Empty RimWorld Play Log

[h1]Description[/h1]
A mod that empties the play log, allowing you to safely uninstall mods that add entries to the log.

Example mods that can be safely removed:

Pawn Education - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1729795429

Craftsmanship - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1472131714

This mod adds a new debug menu option called 'Clear Play Log' under the category 'Mods - Misc' . This prevents exceptions from occuring when opening the 'Log' or 'Social' tabs on a pawn after a mod that inserts to the Play Log has been removed.

To use:
1. Disable the mod you want to uninstall
2. Load your existing save (ignore warnings)
3. Click the debug action 'Clear Play Log'
4. Make a new save
5. profit???

Not really sure if there are other ramifications involved with clearing the Play Log, so use at your own risk.
